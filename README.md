# C-Project-Submit

Download project in Visual studio and build. It uses entity framework, unobtrusive validation, and jquery validation.

Project has been tested on a second computer and it compiled and ran properly.

The project is a wargame army tracker. It stores basic information about armies for wargames I play. 

The database should auto seed with two basic armies in the tracker. You can add, delete, and update the armies.

The main page displays a random fact at the bottom of the page. There are only 5 but it is easily expandable with Razor.

The page is fully responsive. I used a responsive table for the Army tracker. Once the screen is smaller that 768 pixels width the 
table becomes fully scrollable instead of shrinking further.

Thank you for your time.
